\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, different human walking styles were analyzed based on radar micro-Doppler signatures and their Fourier transforms. We showed the capability of radar to serve as a diagnostic tool and long-term monitoring device of human gait. Methods were presented to perform gait recognition utilizing the cadence-velocity domain, where five different walking styles were distinguished including limping and walking with a cane. Here, subspace-based features were superior to standard physical features in solving the intra motion category classification problem of discerning different human gaits.
