\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec_conclusion}

There has been considerable interest in applying SDN concepts within IoT in order to introduce greater network programmability and provide a platform for virtualizing network functions and services. Though there has been progress towards defining and addressing the unique challenges posed by implementing SDN architecture within constrained wireless networks, one of the fundamental issues has been the inherent unreliability between between the SDN controller and nodes within the mesh. This paper has presented initial efforts to provide dedicated SDN control slices in an SDN-enabled IEEE 802.15.4-2015 network. We have demonstrated that by using IETF 6TiSCH tracks, we can create an isolated network slice for SDN control traffic; ensuring that the SDN overhead will not interfere with the performance of other network flows, whilst providing deterministic properties to SDN controller communications.
