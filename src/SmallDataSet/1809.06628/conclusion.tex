In this paper, we presented an MAV that is capable of fast autonomous indoor and outdoor flight without the aid of external infrastructure, solely relying on an omnidirectional laser scanner for localization.
We approached this challenge by employing fast 6D lidar based localization in 3D maps in combination with time-optimal model predictive control. Due to the fast runtime of our methods, the MAV motion can be tracked and controlled even under high velocities and accelerations.
Our ROS-based mapping and navigation pipeline allows for fully autonomous flight even in GNSS-denied environments.

Ample onboard processing power in combination with a high bandwidth ground connection and long battery life leads to a system that is suitable to be deployed, \eg in warehouses for extensive stocktaking applications.
We demonstrated the system robustness in multiple experiments where the only manual interactions were the starting and landing phases.
