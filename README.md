 - [test](test) is the modified code intended to be run in an HPC environment, specifically on the [Sherlock cluster](https://sherlock.stanford.edu) at Stanford. This first go was a test analysis, and imperfect as it wasn't run on all the data.
 - [analysis](analysis) is a (hopefully) more complete run of the analysis, where we also take an inventory of files.
